# Masked Modelling in Chess
Masked modeling has found much success as a representation learning strategy for natural language and computer vision applications. This project explores the possibilities for masked modeling in chess. We construct our investigation through a piece prediction task where we mask squares on a chess board and ask our model to predict the identity of the masked squares. We evaluate the learned representations from this procedure by applying them to two downstream tasks: detecting [forks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(chess)) and solving chess puzzles.
